# Lab: Refactoring Code to Comply with PEP 8 (Style Guide for Python)

In this series of exercises, we learn how to refactor code for better readiblity according to PEP 8 guidelines.

## Activity 1: Indentation

Consider the following guidelines:

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Maximum line length is 79 characters.
- Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent. Refer to class slides for visual explanation.

Now,

1. Study the file 'indentation2.py' and fix all indentation issues.
2. Compare your modified file with "indentation2_refactored.py"

## Activity 2: Whitespaces and Naming Convention

1. Fix all whitespace and naming convention issues of the file "whitespace_naming_convention2.py". 
1. Compare your modified file with "whitespace_naming_convention2_refactored.py".

## Activity 3: Docstrings

1. Add necessary docstrings to the file "".
1. Compare your modified file with "".
